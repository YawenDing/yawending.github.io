## About Me

I am an applied microeconomist working on environmental, health, and development issues. I have been a post-doctoral fellow in the [School of Economics and Management](https://sem.tongji.edu.cn/semch/) at the [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) since September 2024. 

I am on the 2024-25 academic job market.

My research interests and approaches are characterized by a focus on real-world problems, a commitment to informing policy, and a dedication to interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly in the fields of Environmental Economics, Health Economics, and Development Economics.

## Research interests

- Environmental Economics (environmental policy; climate change; water pollution; air pollution; green finance)
- Health Economics (environmental health; nutrition; health policy)
- Development Economics (aid; human capital)
