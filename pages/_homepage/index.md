## About Me

I am an applied economist with research interests in poverty alleviation, labor markets, early childhood development, women’s empowerment, and other key issues in development economics. A large fraction of my work focuses on one of China’s large-scale Moving to Opportunity programs—the Poverty Alleviation Relocation Program—which relocated approximately 9.6 million impoverish individuals from mountainous and remote areas during 2016-2020.

Since September 2024, I have been serving as an Assistant Professor in the [School of Economics and Management](https://sem.tongji.edu.cn/semch/) at the [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/). I am also a member of the Youth Committee of the China Agricultural Economics Association.

## Research interests

- Development Economics (poverty alleviation, women empowerment, early childhood development, rural-urban migration)
- Health Economics (midwife training)
- Urban Economics (the interaction between housing regulations and household behaviors)
- Economic History (the Great Leap Famine, Household Responsibility System, and other key events)
